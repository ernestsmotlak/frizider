## UI/UX Ideas

### Fridge Icon Instead of Hamburger Menu
Instead of using a traditional hamburger menu icon, use a fridge icon that can toggle between:
- **Closed fridge icon** - When the navigation menu is closed/collapsed
- **Open fridge icon** - When the navigation menu is open/expanded

This would be thematically appropriate for a refrigerator inventory management app and adds a fun, on-brand touch to the UI.

**Implementation notes:**
- The icon state changes based on menu open/closed state
- Could use SVG icons for better scalability
- Animation between states could be smooth (door opening/closing effect)
